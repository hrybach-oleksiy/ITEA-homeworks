                    <span>The world we live in is changing and it is changing rapidly.</span>
                    Whether this is driven
                    by technology,
                    globalisation or in response to specific crises, there is no doubt that the workplace of today needs
                    to
                    constantly adapt to ongoing changes in order to remain efficient and competitive.

                    In more traditional work settings, the definition of a good employee was someone who came to the
                    office
                    on time at 9 a.m., sat at their desk and worked hard, taking direction from their managers and
                    following
                    the rules. This model employee would be there rain or shine, always appearing busy until it was time
                    to
                    go home at 6 p.m. But with the development of smartphones and internet technologies, many companies
                    are
                    starting to form virtual teams with team members living in different time zones, and employees are
                    now
                    finding themselves answering emails, attending meetings and working on reports from home outside
                    their
                    usual working hours. People now need to work smarter and not just harder.

                    Successful business requires collaboration and teamwork. For team relationships to work well, we
                    need
                    high levels of trust. But how we build trust can differ from person to person, culture to culture.
                    Becoming aware of this can help us see how to improve trust with the people we work with.

                    When Valeria first met her international clients, she tried to bond with them by telling them about
                    her
                    family and her parenting style. She showed them photos of her children on her phone. Her clients
                    felt
                    that her behaviour was unprofessional and it was difficult for them to trust her.

                    During a team-building exercise, employees at a British firm were asked to share some personal
                    facts.
                    Kelly wanted to make a good impression on her new colleagues. She talked about how she was the top
                    student of her year at high school and how she won a scholarship to university. The following day
                    her
                    colleagues spoke to each other about how uncomfortable they felt about her boasting.

                    On the first day of a course, trainer David aimed to reassure his new trainees that they were in
                    good
                    hands. He talked enthusiastically about the big corporations he had previously worked in and the
                    famous
                    clients he had trained. He mentioned the good feedback he'd received and showed the results he was
                    able
                    to provide for his clients. The participants on the training course found this information boring
                    and
                    irrelevant. They wanted him to begin the training and not waste time talking about his previous
                    achievements.

                <p class="trust__strong">Why did this happen?</p>
                <p>
                    There are many ways of building trust, and the approach we choose might depend on the relationship
                    we
                    are building, the culture we are used to and our personal preferences. However, if the methods we
                    choose
                    do not match the expectations of the people around us, it can lead to misunderstandings and negative
                    assessments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's consider different approaches to building trust. Author and speaker Richard Barrett suggests
                    that
                    there are two main components of trust: character and competence. One way of building trust is to
                    show
                    that we are caring, fair, open and honest human beings. In other words, we can build trust by
                    showing
                    our character. Another way to build trust is by letting others know that we are capable, experienced
                    and
                    have achieved excellent results. This way of building trust emphasises our competence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can be a useful exercise to analyse specific work relationships in terms of the
                    character/competence
                    model. You might think about the type of trust your relationship has and the type of trust your
                    relationship lacks, in order to see how you can develop. Many of us use both approaches, depending
                    on
                    the context. For example, in a job interview, we might focus on establishing trust by demonstrating
                    our
                    competence through work experience. When we are working within a team, we might prioritise showing
                    our
                    character to form close professional relationships. By becoming aware of the context and how our
                    conversation partners are responding to our trust-building efforts, we can adapt the way we build
                    trust
                    to better suit them.

                <p>
                    It might be tempting to think you can do everything faster and better than your team members. It
                    might
                    be hard to hand over tasks you enjoy doing. But attempting to do everything all by yourself shows
                    poor
                    leadership and can end in personal burnout. You end up overworked, stressed and unable to be the
                    leader
                    your team needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Leading a team brings new responsibilities and challenges, and managers need to learn to delegate as
                    much as possible. That means sharing or transferring some of your responsibilities, and trusting
                    other
                    people to do some of the work that you normally do. Effective delegation gives you the time and
                    space to
                    offer the support needed, deal with the problems that arise and keep an eye on the bigger picture â€“
                    things that a leader should be doing.
                </p>
                <p class="mt">As you consider what tasks to delegate, here are five tips on how you can delegate
                    effectively.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Start with smaller tasks</h3>
                        If you're worried about handing over large projects, start by delegating the smaller tasks that
                        don't
                        require much overseeing. This will also give your team members time to get used to their new
                        responsibilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Delegate tasks that will develop your team members</h3>
                        Delegation shouldn't just be about reducing your workload. It should also be about developing
                        your team
                        and giving them learning opportunities. Choose tasks that help their professional development,
                        and allow
                        them time to get better at doing them. By passing on work you are good at doing yourself and
                        training
                        your team members to do it, you're helping them grow professionally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Delegate tasks to people who might like them</h3>
                        A good team leader knows their team well and knows which tasks would suit which person best.
                        Don't just
                        delegate tasks you don't like doing. When people are doing tasks they enjoy, they're more
                        motivated to
                        do the best job they can do.
